### Hi, I am Konrad Gumienny. Check Out my Profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am a highly skilled web developer with a strong focus on the concept of application development rather than the technologies used to do so. My passion for programming started at a young age and I have been continuously developing my skills since then. I have a deep understanding of software development concepts and have worked with various languages, frameworks, and tools.

 Recently, I had the opportunity to work in a three-person team responsible for building an OTRS module that extends the system with Elasticsearch for a client from Germany. As a member of this team, I assisted in making key decisions during the module design process. I independently developed a frontend module using VueJS that includes a search bar allowing users to easily set search parameters and view results on the screen.

 In addition to my front-end expertise, I have experience in building RESTful APIs and working with Laravel. I am always eager to learn and grow as a developer, and I thrive on new challenges. My strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to work well in a team make me a valuable asset to any project.

 Of course, you can contact me about working together at any time. I'd be happy to talk about your project and showcase my experience and skills that can contribute to its success.
