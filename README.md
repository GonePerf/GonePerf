### Hi, I am Konrad Gumienny. Check Out my Profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am currently writing my diploma thesis at the end of my studies. I am also looking for a university where I could start my master's studies. Thanks to Neti, I gain experience in commercial projects. Every day I develop my programming skills because it is my passion. I have a lot of knowledge in the field of relational databases, object-oriented programming and design patterns.

I have been creating web applications in Angular & PHP Vue & Firebase for over a year.  and creating a simple CRUD application only takes a few hours.

My skills are confirmed by the obtained certificates, projects on my GitHub and the scholarship that I obtained for good academic results.
