### Hi, I am Konrad Gumienny. Check Out my Profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am in the third year of IT studies. Every day I develop my programming skills because it is my passion. I have a lot of knowledge in the field of relational databases, object-oriented programming and design patterns.

I have been creating web applications in Angular for over half a year. I've already mastered most of the framework's capabilities, and creating a simple CRUD application only takes a few hours. As for the backend, I used Firebase and Laravel.

My skills are confirmed by the obtained certificates, projects on my GitHub and the scholarship that I obtained for good academic results.
